The generated articles will be saved in the content/posts folder with the article title as the file name and a .mdx extension.

### Step 6: Run the Next.js blog template
To run the Next.js blog template locally, use the following command:
```
npm run dev
```
This will start the development server, and you can view your blog by opening http://localhost:3000 in your web browser.

#### Step 7: Deploy your blog

## Future Features

Here are some exciting features we're planning to add to the project in the future:

1.  **Automated Article Generation**: Implement a Vercel cron job to automate the process of creating articles on a timely basis. This feature will allow you to schedule article generation and automatically publish new content on your blog.
    
2.  **Langchain Integration**: Harness the power of agents, chains, and tools from Langchain to expand the capabilities of the project, such as:
    
    -   Generating drafts for research papers based on reference papers from arXiv.org.
    -   Creating blog posts inspired by Wikipedia articles.
    -   Exploring endless possibilities for generating unique and engaging content.
3.  **Text-to-Speech Audio**: Integrate Elvenlab API to generate text-to-speech audio files for each article, providing an alternative way for users to consume content on your blog. This feature will improve the accessibility of your content and enhance the overall user experience.
    

As the project evolves, we'll continue to explore new ways to make content generation more efficient, engaging, and versatile. Stay tuned for updates!
